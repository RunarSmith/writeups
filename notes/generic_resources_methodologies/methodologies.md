# Workflow

Here's a basic workflow that an ethical hacker might follow to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, and produce a good report for the customer:

1. Planning and reconnaissance: The first step in the process is planning and reconnaissance. This involves gathering information about the target system, such as its network topology, IP addresses, open ports, and software versions. This information can be obtained through various techniques, such as port scanning, network mapping, and information gathering tools.

2. Vulnerability assessment: Once the reconnaissance is complete, the next step is to identify vulnerabilities in the target system. This can be done through various techniques, such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and manual testing. The goal is to identify as many vulnerabilities as possible and assess their severity and potential impact on the system.

3. Exploitation: After identifying the vulnerabilities, the ethical hacker will attempt to exploit them to gain access to the target system. This can involve various techniques, such as exploiting software vulnerabilities, brute-force attacks, social engineering, and phishing attacks. The goal is to gain access to sensitive information or to take control of the target system.

4. Reporting: Once the exploitation phase is complete, the ethical hacker will document their findings in a report for the customer. The report should include a detailed description of the vulnerabilities found, their severity and potential impact, and recommendations for how to mitigate them. The report should also include a clear explanation of the methodology used, the tools and techniques employed, and any challenges or obstacles encountered during the testing process.

5. Follow-up: Finally, the ethical hacker should follow up with the customer to ensure that the vulnerabilities have been mitigated and that the system is secure. They may also offer additional services, such as ongoing vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, to help the customer maintain the security of their system over time.

It's important to note that this is just a basic workflow and that every ethical hacker may have their own unique approach to the testing process. Additionally, the specific tools and techniques used will depend on the target system and the goals of the testing. However, this basic workflow should provide a good starting point for conducting ethical hacking and producing a comprehensive report for the customer.

## simple host target

Here's a more detailed breakdown of a possible workflow for ethical hacking on a simple host:

1. Scope Definition: Define the scope of the engagement, including the target host or hosts, and any limitations or restrictions.

2. Information Gathering: Use various techniques to gather information about the target host, such as port scanning, banner grabbing, and OS fingerprinting. This information will help identify any open ports, services, and operating system being used on the target host.

3. Vulnerability Scanning: Perform vulnerability scanning using automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weak passwords. This can include using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Nmap.

4. Manual Testing: Use manual testing to verify the vulnerabilities identified in step 3 and to identify any additional vulnerabilities. This can include performing fuzzing, input validation testing, and password cracking.

5. Exploitation: Attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities identified in step 4 to gain access to the target host. This can include exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications, misconfigured services, or weak passwords. The goal is to gain unauthorized access to the host and obtain sensitive information or control over the system.

6. Privilege Escalation: If access to the target host is obtained, attempt to escalate privileges to gain more control over the system. This can include exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system, application software, or configuration settings.

7. Reporting: Once testing is complete, prepare a report for the customer detailing the vulnerabilities found, their potential impact, and recommendations for remediation. The report should include a description of the methodology used, the tools and techniques employed, and any obstacles encountered.

8. Remediation: Work with the customer to remediate the vulnerabilities identified in the report. This can include patching software, modifying configurations, or changing passwords.

9. Verification: Verify that the vulnerabilities have been remediated by performing a follow-up scan and manual testing. This will ensure that the vulnerabilities have been properly addressed and the system is secure.

10. Follow-up: Offer ongoing security services to the customer, such as regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, to ensure the continued security of the target host.

This is just one possible workflow, and it can be adjusted depending on the specific needs of the customer and the target host. Additionally, it's important to note that ethical hacking should only be conducted with the permission and consent of the target host owner.

## environement with Active Directory / Lateral movement

Here's a more detailed breakdown of a possible workflow for ethical hacking on an environment with an Active Directory and lateral movements:

1. Scope Definition: Define the scope of the engagement, including the target environment, any limitations or restrictions, and whether the engagement includes lateral movements.

2. Information Gathering: Use various techniques to gather information about the target environment, including Active Directory, domain controllers, and other network devices. This information will help identify users, groups, network topology, and software versions being used in the target environment.

3. Enumeration: Enumerate Active Directory to identify users, groups, and their privileges. This can include using tools like Bloodhound or PowerView to map the environment, find privileges, and identify trust relationships.

4. Vulnerability Scanning: Perform vulnerability scanning using automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the target environment. This can include using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Nmap.

5. Credential Harvesting: Harvest credentials using techniques such as password spraying, phishing, or brute-forcing. This will help to gain access to user accounts and increase the likelihood of lateral movement.

6. Initial Access: Use the obtained credentials to gain initial access to the target environment, such as a compromised user account or a vulnerable system.

7. Lateral Movement: Once initial access is obtained, attempt to move laterally across the network by compromising additional systems or escalating privileges. This can include using tools like Mimikatz or PsExec to move laterally and exploit additional vulnerabilities.

8. Persistence: Establish persistence within the environment to ensure continued access. This can include setting up backdoors or creating new user accounts with elevated privileges.

9. Reporting: Once testing is complete, prepare a report for the customer detailing the vulnerabilities found, their potential impact, and recommendations for remediation. The report should include a description of the methodology used, the tools and techniques employed, and any obstacles encountered.

10. Remediation: Work with the customer to remediate the vulnerabilities identified in the report. This can include patching software, modifying configurations, or changing passwords.

11. Verification: Verify that the vulnerabilities have been remediated by performing a follow-up scan and manual testing. This will ensure that the vulnerabilities have been properly addressed and the environment is secure.

12. Follow-up: Offer ongoing security services to the customer, such as regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, to ensure the continued security of the environment.

Again, this is just one possible workflow, and it can be adjusted depending on the specific needs of the customer and the target environment. It's important to note that ethical hacking should only be conducted with the permission and consent of the target environment owner.
