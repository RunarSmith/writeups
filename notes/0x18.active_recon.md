# Active enumeration

Common active reconnaissance tools and methods include the following:

Host enumeration
Network enumeration
User enumeration
Group enumeration
Network share enumeration
Web page enumeration
Application enumeration
Service enumeration
Packet crafting

# Web service enumeration (ports 80,443)

## vhost enumeration

vhost reconnaissance is not always a yes/no reply based on stattus codes. One in many ways to go is to trigger response size (web page content size).

First, do a quick dummy enumeration and get the response size for a default answer :

```shell
ffuf -u http://example.com/ -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/deepmagic.com-prefixes-top500.txt -r 2> /dev/null | sed 's/.*Size: \([0-9]*\).*/\1/p' | uniq
```

When you have the difault response size, you can go for real shot :

```shell
ffuf -u http://example.com/ -H "Host: FUZZ.example.comb" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -r -fs 18048
```

Options used :
- follow redirect : `-r`
- dictionnary : `-w`
- Header to fuzz: `-H`
- Filter on response size : `-fs`. check also for filtering on wordswith `-fw`, or other filtering options `-f*`
